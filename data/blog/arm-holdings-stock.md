# In midst of a gold rush, sell shovels.

We are living in the era of the AI Gold Rush. Fortunes are being created in companies that directly or indirectly deal with AI -be it OpenAI's ChatGPT, NVIDIA with the bleeding edge chips powering AI mechanisms, Microsoft, Alphabet, Meta and other big tech compnanies either directly integrating AI to their existing services, or bringing new services like the Llama model by Meta, and Gemini and Bard by Alphabet. 
In this article, we take a deep dive into ARM Holdings Plc. a British semiconductor design company that primarily designs CPU cores. 

Total Units of Ordinary Shares: 1,025,234,000

Units owned by Softbank: 769,029,000 | 75.01% ownership of ARM

ADS Depository Institution: Citibank

1 ADS = A ordinary Share redeemable. A holder of ADS, however, is not treated as holder of ordinary share.

What it takes to design high-end chips?

The resources required to develop leading-edge products are significant and continue to increase exponentially as manufacturing process nodes shrink. According to the International Business Strategy, Inc. (“IBS”), IC design costs were approximately $249 million for a 7nm chip and approximately $725 million for a 2nm chip, representing approximately a 3X increase in design cost as compared to a 7nm chip.

To design a 2nm chip, IBS estimates that the software development, verification, and IP qualification is 71% of the overall cost

ARM and CUSTOM Sillicon

The success of Arm-based products such as Amazon’s Graviton, deployed across Amazon data centers globally, have demonstrated the opportunity to create a sustainable competitive advantage through this approach. Amazon claims that Graviton delivers up to 40% better price performance over comparable x86-based systems

What's in an ARM's grab? The Total Addressable Market.

AN AVERAGE 1.7% ROYALTY REVENUE ON ALL OFFERINGS.

Total Addressable Market will get to $246.6bn by 2025.

We estimate that the aggregate value of chips containing Arm technology was approximately $98.9 billion in the calendar year ended December 31, 2022, representing an approximate 48.9% market share as compared to an approximate 42.3% market share as of December 31, 2020.

Major Risks Relating to ARM Holdings

Competition Risk.

Standards RISK - Demand for our products and services depends substantially on their acceptance by semiconductor and systems companies and their compatibility with, and the costs of, the design and manufacturing processes of our customers.

China RISK - Our concentration of revenue from the PRC market makes us particularly susceptible to economic and political risks affecting the PRC, which could be exacerbated by tensions between (on the one hand) the U.S. or the U.K. and (on the other hand) the PRC with respect to trade and national security. More on China Risk Beow.

A significant portion of our total revenue is generated from a limited number of key customers. In particular, our top five customers (including Arm China) collectively accounted for approximately 57% and 56% of our total revenue for the fiscal years ended March 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively, and our largest customer individually, Arm China, accounted for approximately 24% and 18% of our total revenue, respectively, during those fiscal years.

Neither we nor SoftBank Group control the operations of Arm China, which operates independently of us. Further More on CHINA RISK

Substantially all PRC-related revenue is earned through the IPLA (IP License Agreement), pursuant to which, among other things, we granted Arm China certain exclusive rights to sublicense our IP to PRC customers. We expect that our licensing relationship with Arm China will continue to account for substantially all of our total revenues from the PRC and represent a significant portion of our revenues for the foreseeable future. It would be difficult for us to replace any lost PRC-sourced revenue in the event that our commercial relationship with Arm China were to terminate or deteriorate. Accordingly, we expect that Arm China will continue to provide our primary access to the PRC market for the foreseeable future. If we fail to maintain our commercial relationship with Arm China, our access to the PRC market could be materially diminished and our business, results of operations, financial condition and prospects for growth could be materially and adversely affected.

### WILD REVENUE STATS

Based on royalty revenue information provided to ARM's by customers in quarterly royalty reports, approximately 46% of our royalty revenue for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2023 came from products released between 1990 to 2012.
ARM is based on Cambridge, England and thus issues a 6-K "Report of foreign issuer" to report their announcements to the SEC.
