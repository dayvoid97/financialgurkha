## Enjin Launches a revolutionary blockchain engineered for NFTs

Enjin, the leading blockchain ecosystem for NFTs and digital items, has released the Enjin Blockchain, a revolutionary blockchain designed specifically for NFTs and digital assets. Unlike other solutions, Enjin Blockchain integrates critical functions like creating, using, and transferring NFTs directly into its code, eliminating the need for smart contracts. This approach allows for scalable, advanced digital assets while maintaining interoperability. Enjin Blockchain balances cost-efficiency, scalability, and security.

## Key Blockchain Features of the Enjin Blockchain

Key features of Enjin Blockchain include Fuel Tanks, which subsidize transaction fees, and Discrete Accounts, which allow users to interact without dedicated wallet software. Integration is made accessible through Enjin's application layer, and Enjin Blockchain empowers creators, enterprises, and individuals to leverage digital assets and NFTs.
Enjin Coin (ENJ), currently priced at $ 0.25 & has a market cap of $252 million, is set to migrate from Ethereum and become the native token of Enjin Blockchain's Mainnet on a 1:1 basis. As part of this transition, there is also a proposed merger between Efinity Token (EFI), priced at $0.03912 with a market cap of $24.7 million, and ENJ. The Efinity Matrixchain, operating as a fork of the Polkadot parachain, is already operational on Enjin Blockchain, ensuring the continuity and integrity of data. This strategic migration and proposed merger demonstrate the commitment of the Enjin ecosystem to leverage the cutting-edge capabilities of Enjin Blockchain and enhance the engagement of the ENJ and EFI communities.

The Enjin Matrixchain, upcoming on Enjin Blockchain, will inherit data from Efinity and use ENJ as the native currency. Additional Matrixchains tailored to enterprise and large communities will be deployed. Existing Enjin community projects are invited to onboard Enjin Blockchain.

## About Enjin the Company

Enjin's App Layer, including Enjin Wallet, NFT.io Marketplace, Enjin Beam, and Enjin Platform, facilitates low-cost NFT integration and can be easily adopted by indie game developers.

Enjin Blockchain and Enjin Matrixchain will be secured by Substrate's Proof-of-Stake system, powered by ENJ, ensuring high levels of security and reliability.

Enjin's history dates back to 2009, and it has since become a pioneer in blockchain innovation. Join the Enjin ecosystem in shaping the future of digital ownership, NFTs, and blockchain technology.
