## MP Materials Valuation Primer

This is the first article in the valulation series at Financial Gurkha. In this article, we are valuing MP Materials, a leading company in the rare-earth mining and processing sector in charge of operating the one and only rare-earth raw materials extracting and processing facility in the North American continent. The impetus for this MP Materials valuation is the recent news relating China's export ban of rare-earth and permanent magnets related technology which we covered in [this article](https://financialgurkha.com/blog/china-rare-earth-tech-export-ban-helps-mp-materials-stock).

## The Valuation Framework

We want to thank Professor Aswath Damodaran, the "Dean of Valuation" at NYU Stern who has graciously been publishing GEMS on valuation, corporate finance and financial markets in general in his [Musing on Markets](https://aswathdamodaran.blogspot.com) blog. We highly recommend everyone to read his blog. He is one of the best and we owe a great deal to his work.

We have used Dr. Damodaran's valuation template, borrowing the Tesla Motors valuation template to make modification to bring the MP Materials Valuation to fruition.
