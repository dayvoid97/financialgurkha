## MP Materials Valuation Primer

This is the first article in the valulation series at Financial Gurkha. In this article, we are valuing MP Materials, a leading company in the rare-earth mining and processing sector in charge of operating the one and only rare-earth raw materials extracting and processing facility in the North American continent. The impetus for this MP Materials valuation is the recent news relating China's export ban of rare-earth and permanent magnets related technology which we covered in [this article](https://financialgurkha.com/blog/china-rare-earth-tech-export-ban-helps-mp-materials-stock).

## The Valuation Framework

We want to thank Professor Aswath Damodaran, the "Dean of Valuation" at NYU Stern who has graciously been publishing GEMS on valuation, corporate finance and financial markets in general in his [Musing on Markets](https://aswathdamodaran.blogspot.com) blog. We highly recommend everyone to read his blog. He is one of the best and we owe a great deal to his work.

We have used Dr. Damodaran's valuation template, borrowing the Tesla Motors valuation template to make modification to bring the MP Materials Valuation to fruition.

_**Note to Readers Regarding Investments and Market Risks**: This is not an investment advice. Our portfolio has MP Materials Stock. We believe there is a great potential for MP Materials and in the objective of using applying objective data and subjective estimate figures to properly assess our estimated value for this company, we conducted the valuation. Stock investments are subject to market risks and thus we strongly recommend our readers and to everybody that reaches this article to consult with a Financial Advisor to make investment decisions._
