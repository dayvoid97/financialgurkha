### Investors Be Aware: MicroCloud Hologram's recent 6-K filing with the SEC allows for reverse-stock split and further stock issue likely resulting in dillution

MicroCloud Hologram Inc. has recently disclosed the outcomes of its 2024 Extraordinary General Meeting of the Shareholders (EGM) held on January 26, 2024, at the company's Shenzhen headquarters where Shareholders approved and adopted significant proposals:

- **Share Consolidation Allows for 10:1 Reverse Split**: Shareholders voted for an immediate consolidation, combining every ten existing ordinary shares into one Consolidated Share with a nominal value of \$0.001. The authorized share capital will be altered from \$50,000 divided into 500,000,000 shares of \$0.0001 each to \$50,000 divided into 50,000,000 shares of \$0.001 each. This is a 10:1 reverse split where 10 unites of stocks will be merged to make 1 unit of stock. **Since \$HOLO is a member of the Nasdaq family of stocks and NASDAQ requires stocks to trade over $1, shareholders likely approved this measure.**

- **Share Capital Increase Allows for Issuance of further 450 million shares**: Following the Share Consolidation with reverse split, the authorized share capital will increase from \$50,000 to \$500,000, divided into 500,000,000 shares of \$0.001 each, including the creation of an additional 450,000,000 shares. At current price, $HOLO can now issue 450 million new shares.
