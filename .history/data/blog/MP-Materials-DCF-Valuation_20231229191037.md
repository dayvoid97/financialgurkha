## MP Materials Valuation Primer

This is the first article in the valulation series at Financial Gurkha. In this article, we are valuing MP Materials, a leading company in the rare-earth mining and processing sector in charge of operating the only rare-earth materials extracting and processing facility in the North American continent. In the Stage III of the company's develpement, MP Materials has begun ["trial production of NdPr metals"](https://twitter.com/MPMaterials/status/1720170905085911278). The impetus for this MP Materials valuation is the recent news relating China's export ban of rare-earth and permanent magnets related technology which we covered in [this article](https://financialgurkha.com/blog/china-rare-earth-tech-export-ban-helps-mp-materials-stock).

**MP Materials has an impressive revenue growth Year over Year. The TTM 2023 revenue backslide is due to decrease in the price of ROE oxides by more than 50% in the year 2023.**

The news in 2023 for MP Materials, ranging from manufacuring of Permanent Magnets to China's Export Ban on rare-earth related-technologies, suggests that MP Materials will continue to grow in their core business. We assume MP Material will capture 30% market share in the long run given the backdrop of aggressive electrification of the automobile industry and massive investments in renewable energy.

## The Valuation Framework

We want to thank Professor Aswath Damodaran, the "Dean of Valuation" at NYU Stern who has graciously been publishing GEMS on valuation, corporate finance and financial markets in general in his [Musing on Markets](https://aswathdamodaran.blogspot.com) blog. We highly recommend everyone to read his blog. He is one of the best and we owe a great deal to his work.

We have used Dr. Damodaran's valuation template, borrowing the Tesla Motors valuation template to make modification to bring the MP Materials Valuation to fruition.
