## SingularityNET

SingularityNET's **AGIX token** has a max supply of 2 billion AGIX and has a market cap of \$663 million.

Singularity NET has the **AGIX** token that is tradable on [major centralized and decentralized exchanges](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/singularitynet/markets). An application layer project in the Ethereum blockchian, Singularity NET is building AGI foundational models while at the same time bootsrapping projects that aim to provide AI services in the fields including but not limited to DeFI, Robotics, Biotech, Longevity, Gaming and Media, Arts and Entertainment, and Enterprise-level AI.

The SingularityNET AI beta marketplace so far has 84 AI projects listed as available services and is garnering more than 10 thousand daily visits, likely indicating the marketplace is gaining traction. Users of the apps transact with AGIX tokens, providing a massive potential value to AGIX holders when the platforms reach critical mass.

## NumerAI

NumerAI's **\$NMR** token has a total supply of 11 million NMR tokens with a current market cap of \$189 million.

Dubbing themselves as the _"last hedge fund"_, the NumerAI model is a "data science competition where you build machine learning models to predict the stock market." NumerAI provides a free database of the financial market that people can use to make predictions and generate signals. The users can then license their signals to NumerAI by making predictions where they stake their NMR tokens. Should the signals make accurate predictions, the users get rewarded with NMR tokens. If the signals are inaccurate, some tokens are burnt. Currently, there's more than \$1.8 million at stake with the NumerAI model.

NumerAI is like a crowd-sourced hedge fund where you place your bets my making predictions. To let their users focus on the prediction, NumberAI provides essential datasets on the financial markets, making the process easier.

Interested in exploring the financial dataset NumerAI provides? [Click here](https://numer.ai/data/v4.2) to learn about the data and the model itself.

### How to profit from NumerAI and NMR Tokens?

    NMR has a working product that already has provided more than $30 million in NMR tokens to the data scientists. You can purchase the NMR tokens in major exchanges and hold them as investments that will generate returns. Or you can learn how to build models and make bold predictions by staking your NMR tokens.

## Ocean Protocol

The Ocean Protocol went public thrugh an IEO in 2019 at the price of \$0.12 per Ocean token. 4 years in the future, \$OCEAN is trading for \$0.51. The Ocean Protocol is one of the well-capitalized projects with a market-cap exceeding \$700mn.

### Where does the value lie in the Ocea Protocol?

The Ocean Protocol's value lies in the Ocean Marketplace which is a decentralized marketplace to securely trade data.

[The Ocean Marketplace](https://market.oceanprotocol.com/) is a functioning marketplace to find, publish, and trade datasets in the Ocean Network. With more than 850 datasets currently available for trade, the Ocean Marketplace has a wide array of data: live orderbook prices, pictures of damaged cars, data on energy marekts, Netflix viewing history and much more.

Data is crucial for AI as data leads to better AI. The Ocean Marketplace is a unique solution in the [big data marketplace](https://explodingtopics.com/blog/big-data-stats) where sales topped \$274 billion in 2022. Unlike giant corporations, data on the Ocean marketplace is available for everyone to use for a price. The Ocean Protocol stands to immensely benefit with provision of more and better data for trade in their marketplace.

With a marketplace to safely share data and protocol to ensure payments, Ocean Protocol stands to benefit massively with the current AI trend.
