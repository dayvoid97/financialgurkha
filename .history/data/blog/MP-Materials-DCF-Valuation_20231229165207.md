This is the first article in the valulation series at Financial Gurkha. In this article, we are valuing MP Materials, a leading company in the rare-earth mining and processing sector in charge of operating the one and only rare-earth raw materials extracting and processing facility in the North American continent. The impetus for this MP Materials valuation is the recent news relating China's export ban of rare-earth and permanent magnets related technology which we covered in [this article](https://financialgurkha.com/blog/china-rare-earth-tech-export-ban-helps-mp-materials-stock).
