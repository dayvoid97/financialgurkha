## NumerAI

NumerAI's token is **\$NMR** with total supply of 11 million NMR tokens and current market cap of \$189 million.

Dubbing themselves as the last hedge fund, the NumerAI model is a "data science competition where you build machine learning models to predict the stock market." NumerAI provides a free database of the financial market that people can use to make predictions and generate signals. The users can then license their signals to NumerAI by making predictions where they stake their NMR tokens. Should the signals make accurate predictions, the users get rewarded with NMR tokens. If the signals are inaccurate, some tokens are burnt. Currently, there's more than \$1.8 million at stake with the NumerAI model.

NumerAI is like a crowd-sourced hedge fund where you place your bets my making predictions. To make it easier for you to predict, NumberAI provides you a lot of essential data on the financial markets, making your process easier.

### How to make money with NMR tokens?

    NMR has a working product that already has provided more than $30 million in NMR tokens to the data scientists. You can purchase the NMR tokens in major exchanges and hold them as investments that will generate returns. Or you can learn how to build models and make bold predictions by staking your NMR tokens.
