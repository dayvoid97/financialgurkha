## Tesla Crushed Q2 2023 Deliveries and Production Figures

**Tesla** has set a new record for car deliveries in the second quarter of 2023, easily crushing the Wall Street consensus of 448,000 deliveries for the quarter ending June. With strong deliveries, Tesla has demonstrated that its recent price cuts are having an impact. This impressive achievement is a testament to the company's commitment to innovation and continuous improvement, and it bodes well for the future of electric vehicles.
