## Semrush Holdings Inc (NYSE: SEMR)

The Semrush S-1 prospectus filing describes the company as "a leading online visibility management SaaS platform that enables businesses globally to identify and reach the right audience for their content in the right context and through the right channels." For me, Semrush is a platform where you can see where to analyze competitors where your competitors are excelling, and experimenting with keywords to get better search visibility. The testament published by Semrush in their S-1 filing helps better understand what Semrush does and why customers are willing to pay the hundreds of dollars Semrush charges to the base-layer of premium users.
