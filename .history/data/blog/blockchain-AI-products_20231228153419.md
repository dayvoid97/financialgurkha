SingularityNET's **AGIX token** has a max supply of 2 billion AGIX and has a market cap of \$663 million.

Singularity NET has the **AGIX** token that is tradable on [major centralized and decentralized exchanges](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/singularitynet/markets). An application layer project in the Ethereum blockchian, Singularity NET is building AGI foundational models while at the same time bootsrapping projects that aim to provide AI services in the fields including but not limited to DeFI, Robotics, Biotech, Longevity, Gaming and Media, Arts and Entertainment, and Enterprise-level AI.

The SingularityNET AI beta marketplace so far has 84 AI projects listed as available services and is garnering more than 10 thousand daily visits, likely indicating the marketplace is gaining traction. Users of the apps transact with AGIX tokens, providing a massive potential value to AGIX holders when the platforms reach critical mass.

## NumerAI

NumerAI's token is **\$NMR** with total supply of 11 million NMR tokens and current market cap of \$189 million.
Dubbing themselves as the last hedge fund, the NumerAI model is a "data science competition where you build machine learning models to predict the stock market." NumerAI provides a free database of the financial market that people can use to make predictions and generate signals. The users can then license their signals to NumerAI by making predictions where they stake their NMR tokens. Should the signals make accurate predictions, the users get rewarded with NMR tokens. If the signals are inaccurate, some tokens are burnt. Currently, there's more than $13 million at stake with the NumerAI model.
