## Semrush Holdings Inc (NYSE: SEMR)

The Semrush S-1 prospectus filing describes the company as "a leading online visibility management SaaS platform that enables businesses globally to identify and reach the right audience for their content in the right context and through the right channels." How I've seen Semrush is very different however. For me, Semrush is a platform that allows you to see how your competitors are doing, how many hits they're getting, what keywords they're excelling in, and how you can achieve the same results as well. Several testimonies provided by Semrush in their S-1 filing validate my perspective of Semrush. See below.
