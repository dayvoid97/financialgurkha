## Semrush Holdings Inc (NYSE: SEMR)

The Semrush S-1 prospectus filing describes the company as "a leading online visibility management SaaS platform that enables businesses globally to identify and reach the right audience for their content in the right context and through the right channels." For me, Semrush is a platform where you can see where to analyze competitors where your competitors are excelling, and experimenting with keywords to get better search visibility. The testament published by Semrush in their S-1 filing helps better understand what Semrush does and why customers are willing to pay the hundreds of dollars Semrush charges **monthly** for the _base-layer_ of premium users.

## A Deeper Dive Into Semrush Inc's Financials

#### Semrush Key Revenue and User Growth Highlights

Semrush has 95,000 paying members with each customer's ARR spend of \$2,868 in 2022, impressive growth from 67,000 customers at an ARR of \$2,123 in 2020 when the company went public. An impressive growth rate of 42% more customers with per customer spend increasing by 35%. These numbers translate to phenomal revenue growth with Semrush having more than doubled their annual revenue from 2020 to 2022. Semrush also boasts more than 800,000 active free users, a highly lucrative user base that could be potentially converted to paying users.

Semrush has had a phenomenal growth since it's start. Digging on the IPO filings, we find impressive milestones. The company, founded in 2008 garnered 1000 paying customers by 2010 which it grew 50-fold to 90,000 paying cuastomers generating \$100 million in Annual Recurring Revenue by 2019. Semrush is a globally-recognized brand that I knew of as an aspiring young blogger back in 2014 when I was barely out of middle school.

**Valuation Input**: We provide a 35% revenue growth rate for the next year and maintain compounded revenue growth rate of 30% for years 2-5 before slowly bringing the growth rate down to risk-free rate for terminal years.

### Semrush Revenue Breakdown by Geographical Region

As much as we'd like to see Semrush's revenue breakdown by each and every country they operate in, which is a lot (_157 countries_), Semrush only provides revenue breakdown by three sectors: US, UK, and Rest of the World. According to Semrush's 2022 10-K filing, the US, UK, and the Rest of the World accounted for 47%, 10%, and 43% of revenue respectively. Refer to the picture below for breakdown of revenue segment since the company went public in 2020.

Semrush is a wonderful growth story, having doubled their revenue in two years since going public. Furthermore, firm's management prides themselves for efficient capital management, having raised only \$37 million in capital to reach ARR exceeding $100 million before going public.

**Valuation Input**: Crunching numbers yielded a significant negative Sales:Capital ratio for Semrush. So, we extrapolated management's prudent capital management into our valuation framework, which gives **Semrush a Sales: Capital ratio of 2.5** for years 6-10 into our valuation. Current Sales: Capital for years 1-5 will be kept at 1 as the company recently went public.

### Sales and Marketing Expenses

An internet company with a massively successful product, Semrush's sales and marketing spend is nearly half of their total revenue. Do we interpret such a sizable marketing spend as driving impressive revenue growth or do intepret it otherwise? Let's go far back to 2019 and see the trend of marketing spend compared to revenue to get a clearer picture.

![Semrush Sales and Marketing Spend to Total Revenue Ratio](/static/img/semrush-sales-marketing-insights.png)

An impressive growth company with a voracious apetite for marketing spend, Semrush spend on sales and marketing is justified. The following excerpt from the company's S-1 filing gives a clearer pictures as to why it's a good idea the company spend such heavily on sales and marketing.

> Based on a survey by McKinsey & Company, globally, the percentage of consumer interactions that are digital increased to 58% in July 2020, up from 36% in December 2019...
> The awareness stage is the most critical part of the digital marketing process, as it introduces a company’s brand to consumers and educates them on its differentiation and value proposition. An initial positive company-consumer interaction improves the efficacy of the digital marketing process. Efficient consumer acquisition enables companies to scale and drive long-term return on investment (“ROI”) on their sales and marketing spend.

The keywords here are **58%, digital marketing, and long-term return on investment on sales and marketing spend.** Semrush has been able to achieve phenomenal growth not only due to their unique value-enhancing product - having a phenomenal product is a given for a company to survive a competitive market- but also because they're able to reach a wider audience due to their aggressive spend on sales and marketing. For Semrush, these marketing dollars are like Capital Expenditurres that will drive their operating margins and income higher in the future.

Speaking of operating margins, let's look at how the company's operations are faring. Fair warning: its ugly, _so far_.
